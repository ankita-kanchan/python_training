<h3>What is a Thread?</h3>

A thread is a unit of execution on concurrent programming. Multithreading is a technique which allows a CPU to execute many tasks of one process at the same time. These threads can execute individually while sharing their process resources.

<h3>What is a Process?</h3>

A process is basically the program in execution. When you start an application in your computer (like a browser or text editor), the operating system creates a process.
